            If you want to exercise your right to have your personal data deleted. You can do it using the following link.<br />
            Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.<br />
            You may only make a request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The request must:<br />
            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.<br />
            Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.<br />
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify the requestor's identity and/or authority to make the request. We do however require you to provide us with an email address to interact with you on this matter.<br />
            Response Timing and Format<br />
            We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.<br />
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.<br />
